### Design concepts used include:

 - OOP in Python 2.7 
 - Classes and constructors 
 - Class methods

This project creates 6 Movie Class objects, 4 properties are passed as arguments into the `__init__` method in the class constructor. They include the name, tagline, image, and youtube trailer url of each movie. The Python structure results in clean, easy to read data, available for a front-end engineer to use in the app/site view.
